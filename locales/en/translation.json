      "title": "🌱 Carbon Footprint",
      "content": "• A carbon footprint is the amount of CO2 and other greenhouse gases emitted due to human activity, including flights. Air travel significantly contributes to emissions because airplanes burn a lot of fuel, producing CO2 and other gases. This leads to global warming, climate change, and air pollution, harming both nature and human health.\n• To reduce your travel-related footprint, consider direct flights — layovers increase emissions. Pack light — less weight = less fuel burned. Use reusable storage instead of plastic.\n• Choose electronic tickets and boarding passes to save paper. For airport transfers, use public transport or carpooling. You can also offset emissions by supporting reforestation or clean energy projects. Separate trash and keep airports clean.\n• By following these tips, you’ll minimize your environmental impact and help fight climate change. Reducing emissions is everyone's responsibility — small changes lead to big results.\n"
